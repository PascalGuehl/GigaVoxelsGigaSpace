# Overview
GigaVoxels is a ray-guided out-of-core, on demand production, and smart caching library used for efficient 3D real-time visualization of highly large and detailed sparse volumetric scenes (SVO : Sparse Voxel Octree).

GigaSpace is a full-customizable out-of-core, on demand production, and smart caching library based on user-defined hierachical arbitrary space partitionning, space &amp; brick visitors, and brick producer using arbitrary data types.

GigaVoxels and GigaSpace are indeed the same tool.
