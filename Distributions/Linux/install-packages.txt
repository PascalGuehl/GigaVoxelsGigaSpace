[UBUNTU]
You need a working cuda installation before running GigaVoxels, you can install it by running:
	apt-get install nvidia-[driver-version] nvidia-modprobe
On trusty (Ubuntu-14.04), the newest driver is nvidia-331-updates
You need to reboot to load the new drivers.

Run:
	dpkg -i [package-name] 	=> you should get error messages about missing dependencies
	apt-get install -f 		=> it will install the missing dependencies.

If you installed the demo package, demo are in /usr/local/gigaspace/bin

[DEBIAN]
