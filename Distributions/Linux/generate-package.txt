[UBUNTU]:
Install debhelper, ubuntu-dev-tools and subversion
generate a gpg-key (gpg --gen-key) to sign the package (you can use default values)
Modify the parameters of makeSourcePackage.sh (svn username, svn url, gpg-key, list of distributions, ...)
Run makeSourcePackage.sh

Generate a pristine development system thanks to pbuilder-dist:
	pbuilder-dist [distrib] [arch] create (where distrib and arch are the distribution name and architecture for which you want to build the package). 

Build the package:
	pbuilder-dist [distrib] build gigaspace-[version]~[distrib].dsc

The resulting packages are in ~/pbuilder/[distrib]_result/

[DEBIAN]:
